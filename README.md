Analysis code for understanding how drift, dispersal, and selection explain deviations in microbial communities
from neutral community dynamics.

The methods are described in the manuscript *Fungal infection alters the selection, dispersal, and drift processes structuring the amphibian skin microbiome* which can be found under `docs/neutral_microbiome.pdf`.  Supplementary material can be found in `docs/supplementary_material.pdf`.
